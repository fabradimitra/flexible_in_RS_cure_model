# flexible_in_RS_cure_model
We relaxed the parametric assumption of the relation between cure fraction and covariates in the context of relative survival Weibull cure model, by using Generalized Additive Models and one-hidden layer Neural Networks. This repository contains three simulation study used to assess the performance of the proposed models against the standard model.
